title: Week 10 - Catching Up
---

This week in class we were told other groups already began creating PRs, so we had to catch up. We made initial contributions by creating issues, and commenting on issues to see if we can work on them. We collectively commented on a documentation issue to see if we can work on it, commented on an issue labeled "good first issue" to improve test coverage (this issue has many components and each contributor chooses one component at a time), and we created issues proposing the translation of the README.md to Spanish as well as the Code of Conduct. When we met outside of class, we got a response for the issues we opened about translating the README.md and the Code of Conduct to SPanish, but they informed us that the documentation is subject to changes from time to time and they do not want to have the burden of having to update multiple places at once. On the bright side, we got the approvaal to work on the components of the test coverage issue. Thus, we all go familiar with the development environment and started reading up on unit testing. We then located the proper folders and files in the code and started creating rough drafts of unit tests that we would like to add. We studied previous PRs as well to see what other developers were doing for similar issues. Our goal for next week is to finish writing our unit tests for our respective files and create a PR so that it can be reviewed ASAP!
