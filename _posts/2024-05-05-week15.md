title: Week 15 - Final Thoughts
---

This week, I really enjoyed listening to the presentations. Everyone had different experiences and perspectives on their journeys the past couple months. Bitwarden, Godot, Spicetify, OpenFoodFacts, freeCodeCamp, p5.js, and Gitlab - seven names that I never heard of before this class, but now have significance. Through 10 presentations, my classmates and I embarked on a journey of discovery, navigating through the intricacies of these projects.

Reflecting on my group's progress, I'm glad we were able to make some progress for TEAMMATES. However, I'm still unsatisfied with my PR failing the lint and components tests on GitHub, so I plan on continuing to work on this until I can get it to pass. Nonetheless, we have created our presentation and are looking forward to sharing our progress with the class.
