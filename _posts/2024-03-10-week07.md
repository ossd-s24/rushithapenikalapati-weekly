title: Week 7 - The Origins of Open Source
---

The origins of free and open source software are deeply rooted in the principles of collaboration, transparency, and freedom. The movement has been shaped by numberous influential figures, each contributing their own unique philosophies, innovations, and leadership to the domain. For example, Guido van Rossum created Python, and Hong Phuc Dang founded FOSSASIA, an organization that promotes the use of open source in Asia. These people who have worked and continued to work in free and open source software development have diverse backgrounds and contributions, but their collective efforts have shaped the technological landscape, ensuring that the spirit of openness continues to thrive and evolve.
