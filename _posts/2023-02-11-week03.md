title: Week 3

As someone who's only moderately familiar with git, the git exercises we did in class were extremely helpful in terms of working collaboratively for the browser extension project. Our team has come up with the idea, created basic files in order for it to be considered an open source project, and begun working on the code. I created the files, and will continue to help with the design aspect this week. The only problems faced so far have been setting up the project and working with git in order to work together, but other than that, no major issues or conflicts!
