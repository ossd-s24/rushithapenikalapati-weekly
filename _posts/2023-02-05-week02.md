A Code of Conduct is important because it establishes clear and concrete expectations for the behavior of the community. It helps create a safe space, which is essential for fostering diversity and collaboration. This in turn brings together various perspectives, skills, and experiences.

I personally would be willing to work on a project that doesn't have a COde of Conduct due to a lack of first-hand experience in terms of the repurcussions of not having a Code of Conduct. But at the same time, lack of having a Code of Conduct signals a lack of trust and a lack of respect for the community.

As for enforcing a Code of Conduct, it's realistic as long as it explains steps and procedures when it is violated. Projects should have a clear, written process for violations, a transparent process for investigating and addressing aforementioned violations, and they should regularly remind community members of the Code of Conduct and its importance. Examples include workshops or resources on inclusive behavior and conflict resolution.
