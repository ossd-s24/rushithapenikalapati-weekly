title: Week 8 - Project Selection
---

Last week when groups were formed, I was absent along with my current group members. So this week was our first meeting in class. We went through a list on GitHub of potential project ideas and talked about our interests and skills such as programming languages we're familiar with and would want to work with. After some discussion, we decided on contributing to Zulip. However, at our next meeting outside of class, it was brought to our attention that in order to contribute to Zulip, we would each have to set up a virtual environment. Due to this complication, we went back to the GitHub list, and decided on another project caled TEAMMATES. TEAMMATES is a free online tool for managing peer evaluations and other feedback paths of your students. It's a cloud-based service for educators and students, and is currently used by hundreds of universities across the world. The best part about this project is that they state that they welcome contributions from developers, and especially students. After looking through the issues, it looks like there are good first issues we would be able to work on. We're very excited to dive in!
