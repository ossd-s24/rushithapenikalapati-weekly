Working on the browser extension with a group was a great experience. It was my first time using git in a collaborative environment so it was a little confusing at first, but I got the hang of it and it turned out to be a good learning experience. I learned that as long as there's good communication, it's not that hard to work with others.

In terms of my contribution to the project, I worked on making sure the project was open source. I created the contributing file, the code of conduct, the licens, and the readme file. I also found the images and implemented them into the code. Through this process, I learned how to use github and how to use the markdown language.

As much as I enjoyed working on and presenting the project, I also enjoyed all of the other teams presentations. From useful to entertaining, I will definitely be using at least one of the other teams' extensions. More specifically, studytool and tiktock were my favorites.
